# JATE-Refactor

## Description
This assignment is a refactor of a text editor, I learned how to handle plugins and other type of webpacks that made this app functional. Having to refactor the application gave me an important understanding of how it works and how we get our bundles installed as our 'dist' folder magically appears. IMPORTANT NOTE: We Walked through this assignment in class with our instructor and TA.

## Usage 
The purpose of the refactor is to teach us the complexity of progressive web applications and how we get our dist folder with our bundled installs and how our src-sw.js and install.js helped make that possible. I also had to install a package '@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread' since our application needed to function and wouldn't without it. We are able to install the text editor which will close the browser and leave us with the installed text-editor.
